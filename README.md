# FlashCardsApp

## Goal

Provide students with a mobile means of creating and studying flashcards. Shareability and customization are key to making this app successful. The app will have a simplistic design that expediates the creation of flashcards and can be shared across multiple devices and multiple users. There will be a customization of studying settings that give users a variety of means to use their flashcards.

## Features

Three important features of this app are: Creation, Customization, and Shareability.

### Creation

Users can manually create individual flashcards or upload a cvs file to mass generate a flashcard pack.

### Customization

Flashcards and flashcard packs can be edited at anytime by the creator. Creators can grant other users access to edit flashcards as well. In addition, the Study mode of the app will have a variety of pre-determined settings that can be toggled and saved. These saved preferences can be applied to different card packs and changed whenever. 

### Shareability

Every flashcard pack will have a unique id generated along with it. Users can share this id for other users to access the flashcard pack. A flashcard pack can be shared indefinietly, as long as the Creator has not deleted the flashcard pack.
